# STOCK MARKET PRICE ANALYSIS
# Project Description:

The project is an analysis of stock price data using PySpark. It covers data loading, cleaning, transformation, basic statistical analysis, advanced analysis using window functions, and saving data in different formats.

# Insights:

Data Cleaning and Transformation: The project demonstrates how to handle raw stock data by parsing dates, converting data types, and cleaning numerical values, which are crucial steps for accurate analysis.
Basic Stock Analysis: It shows how to calculate basic statistics, such as maximum and minimum stock prices, total volume traded, and average stock prices over different time periods.
Advanced Analysis: It uses window functions to calculate moving averages, identify the top highest closing prices, and compare current stock prices with previous day's prices.
Data Storage: The project explores different data storage formats, such as Parquet and CSV, and discusses their advantages and disadvantages for storing the processed data.
Spark SQL: It demonstrates how to use Spark SQL to query the data using SQL-like syntax, which can be useful for complex analysis.
Performance Optimization: Although not fully implemented, it mentions performance considerations, such as using accumulators and broadcast variables, optimizing data partitioning, and understanding shuffle operations.
# Overall:

The project provides a comprehensive overview of using PySpark for stock price analysis, covering various aspects from data cleaning to advanced analytics. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for understanding stock market trends and making informed investment decisions.
